# Sass loader once for [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)

## Install

`npm install sass-loader-once --save-dev`

The sass-loader-once requires [sass-loader](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader) and requires [node-sass-import-once](https://github.com/at-import/node-sass-import-once) and requires [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) and [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
as [`peerDependency`](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#peerdependencies). Thus you are able to specify the required versions accurately.
